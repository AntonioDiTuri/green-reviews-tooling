There is something with this exec function

import dagger
import asyncio

async def main():
    async with dagger.Connection() as client:
        ctr = client.container().from_("alpine")
        result = await ctr.with_exec(["echo", "hello from dagger"]).stdout()
        print(result)

asyncio.run(main())


example in python, valid also for go.
There must be something about how to run those commands in dagger. 
I don't understand the shit very well. 
Do I need to?

Let's see tomorrow :) 

Keep on coding
