How to use the proposal template:

- Make a copy of the respective proposal file in [proposals](../proposals/) directory.
- Set the name of the file to contain the next logical number and the name of the feature.
- Fill out at least the Status, Motivation and Goals/Non-Goals fields.
- Open a PR to the [green-reviews-tooling](https://github.com/cncf-tags/green-reviews-tooling) repository.
- Merge early and iterate.
