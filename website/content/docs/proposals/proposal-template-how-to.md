# Proposals

How to use the proposal template:

- Make a copy of this file in this (`docs/proposals/`) directory
- Set the name of the file to contain the next logical number and the name of the feature
- Fill out at least the Status, Motivation and Goals/Non-Goals fields.
- Open a PR to the `green-reviews-tooling` repository
- Merge early and iterate
