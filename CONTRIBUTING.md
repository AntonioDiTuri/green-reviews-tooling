# Contribution Guide

First and foremost, thank you for contributing to this project led by the
[CNCF Environmental Sustainability TAG](https://github.com/cncf/tag-env-sustainability)!
We really appreciate your time and willingness to contribute. The [Green Reviews
Working Group](https://github.com/cncf/tag-env-sustainability/tree/main/working-groups/green-reviews)
is an entirely volunteer-led open-source project where we innovate
in the open in the hopes of making this architectural reference available to
everyone who operates in a cloud-native environment.

Read on to learn more about the project and how to contribute. As always, please
don't hesitate to ask if anything is unclear. We value questions, guidance, and
suggestions - they help us build the right thing.
